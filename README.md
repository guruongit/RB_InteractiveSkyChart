# RB_InteractiveSkyChart            
           
An interactive sky chart is a map that presents the night sky as seen by the eyes in real-time. These charts present the positions of celestial bodies like the Moon, International Space Station, Stars, Constellations, all planets of our solar system, and all deep-sky objects that can be seen without the use of optical aid. **STARGAZERS, ASTRONOMERS USES  INTERACTIVE SKY CHART TO EXPLORE THE HEAVENS**.
  
This program uses CPP programing language to make the stated chart that plots stars, planets, and other celestial bodies visible to the unaided eyes from any location, at any time of the day, on any date between the years 2005 to 2030, by simply entering your location in latitude and longitude. And it can plot heavens visible from anyone’s roof and can tell direction for to chase any star in the sky and it also tells anyone’s zodiac sign.

## About Code -

   **Libraries Needed** - “iostream”, “math.h”, “time.h”, “unistd.h”, “Fstream” 
 
   **Major Functions Defined in the code -**
Zodiac - It finds the zodiac sign  
presentconst - It finds and prints the name of the constellation present in the sky as per the input. 
AVI - It finds the range of longitude of the sky as per input. 
SVI - It finds the range of latitude of the sky as per input. 
displayconstchart - It displays a complete sky chart. 
displayconst - It displays any specific object which was listed in the sky chart. 
location - It for to update the sky chart as per the location. 
wheretolook – It to tell where to chase for star/ 
Compass – It computes direction for wheretolook function. 
 
   **Classes Defined in the code -** 
constellation - It stores data of each constellation. 
stars - It stores data of each star. 
planets - It stores data of each planet. 

## SCOPE - 
 
It helps stargazers, astronomers, and other night sky observers in tracking their point of interest so that they can easily direct their telescopes to track anything they want to track in the sky and practice astronomy. Using this program anyone can know where and when to focus. This program could be used to make a sky chart of past and future as well so that anyone using this program can easily plan for their gazing and experimental activity.
